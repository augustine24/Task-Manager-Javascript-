# Task-Manager-Javascript-
A task manager that lets you schedule things you need to do. This repository highlights basic CSS and Javascript skills. Here's how to get this working. By opening an IDE such as Visual Studio Code on Windows(if you don't know what that is here is a summary: https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide , one can then open apps.js and the html file in the repository through said IDE(again in this case, I used visual studio code which is free on Windows), then they can debug/run the html file, which let's you see and use the task manager app. It lets you add, view and delete tasks in calendar format. It's in a very simplistic state.

Thanks for reading.
